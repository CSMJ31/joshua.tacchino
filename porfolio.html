  <h2>Fresno California</h2>
  <p>I'm a 15 year old boy that enjoys games and school for the most part, but absolutely dread homework. </p>
  <p> I would one day like to go off to college up in Washington and then get a job in Technology. </p>
<p> I find coding very interesting and I could see myself doing it as a job in the future but I want to keep my oppstions open and not just limit myself to just coding.</p>					 </div>
